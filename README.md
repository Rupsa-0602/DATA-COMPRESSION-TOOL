This C program is a simple implementation of **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)** that can compress and decompress text files, including those with multiple lines. I wrote this program using the **C Programming Editor**, and I used **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) as the platform to edit, compile, and test the code. The compilation was done using a standard **C/C++ compiler**, like GCC, which supports efficient execution of C programs. The main goal of this project was to understand how text-based compression works by reducing repeated characters into a single character followed by a count, which is especially useful in simple data compression scenarios. The program supports both compression and decompression modes. In compression, it reads each character of the input file, counts how many times a character repeats consecutively, and then writes that character along with its count into a new output file. Special handling is done for newline characters (`\n`) so that line breaks are not lost during compression. During decompression, the program reverses the process — it reads the compressed data and reconstructs the original content by repeating each character according to its count, again restoring newlines correctly. This project gave me practical experience with file handling in C, working with characters, strings, loops, and conditional statements. It also taught me how to manage real-world problems like multi-line handling and file stream reading. Overall, it’s a small but valuable program that demonstrates basic data compression logic in a clean, structured way, and serves as a solid exercise in both file processing and algorithm implementation in C.
